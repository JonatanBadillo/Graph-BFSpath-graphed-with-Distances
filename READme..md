# Graph with BFS path graphed with distances

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph at a certain depth before moving to the next level. It is an important algorithm because it can be used to solve a variety of problems, such as finding the shortest path between two nodes, determining if a graph is connected, and detecting cycles in a graph.

Visualizing the BFS traversal of a graph can be very helpful in understanding its structure and relationships between nodes. Plotting a graph in Python using a library like NetworkX and visualizing the BFS traversal path can make it easier to understand and communicate graph-related problems and solutions.
