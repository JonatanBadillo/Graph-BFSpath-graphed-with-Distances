# Graph with BFS path graphed with distances

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph at a certain depth before moving to the next level. It is an important algorithm because it can be used to solve a variety of problems, such as finding the shortest path between two nodes, determining if a graph is connected, and detecting cycles in a graph.

Visualizing the BFS traversal of a graph can be very helpful in understanding its structure and relationships between nodes. Plotting a graph in Python using a library like NetworkX and visualizing the BFS traversal path can make it easier to understand and communicate graph-related problems and solutions.

### Explanation

In this example we can see that the first node of the search is in color Red, and the distances of each node are based on the adjacent nodes of the directed gaph

In summary, the BFS algorithm and graph visualization in Python are important tools for solving graph-related problems and understanding the structure and relationships within a graph.
